            <p class="about-text">Hi , My name is Godrine Manu and I am a Software Development<br>
             Ã€s a student following Software Development , I like to make mini <br>
             projects that help me develop into a great a programmer.<br>
              Music really does have a therapeutic feel to it for many, including myself.<br>
               Music is very important to me and I truly believe it has the power to<br>
                heal the mind, the soul, and maybe even in some cases, the body. 
            </p>
